Fading LED Sketch
This Arduino sketch demonstrates how to create a smooth fading effect on an LED using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

How it Works
The sketch uses two for loops to gradually increase and then decrease the brightness of an LED. The brightness is controlled by the analogWrite() function, which takes a value from 0 (off) to 255 (full brightness).

The rampTime Variable
The rampTime variable controls the speed of the fading effect.

It acts as a small delay (in milliseconds) between each tiny step in brightness.

A smaller rampTime value makes the LED fade faster.

A larger rampTime value makes the LED fade slower.

By changing the value of rampTime, you can easily adjust the duration of the fade, making the LED "breathe" at your desired pace.
